### Pages

| Route | Page | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/` | Budget | Main budget view with categories, transactions, and summary |
| `/recurring` | Recurring | Manage recurring payments and subscriptions |
| `/settings` | Accounts | Bank account management and Teller integration |
| `/insights` | Insights | Insights hub with Monthly Summary and future analytics |

### Database

The app uses SQLite for local data storage with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.

**Database Commands:**
```bash
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes to database
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio to view/edit data
npm run db:generate  # Generate migration files
npm run db:migrate   # Run migrations
```

**Database Schema:**
- **budgets** - Monthly budget containers (month, year, buffer amount)
- **budget_categories** - Categories within each budget (Income, Giving, etc.)
- **budget_items** - Individual line items (e.g., "Gas", "Groceries"), with optional link to recurring payments
- **transactions** - Individual transactions linked to budget items
- **split_transactions** - Child allocations when a transaction is split across categories
- **linked_accounts** - Connected bank accounts from Teller
- **recurring_payments** - Recurring bills and subscriptions with frequency, amount, and due dates

### How to Use

1. **Navigate the Dashboard**: Use the collapsible sidebar to access Budget, Accounts, and Insights
2. **Connect your bank** (optional): Go to Accounts and connect your bank account via Teller
3. **Set starting balance**: Enter the buffer amount (money carried over from previous month)
4. **Set up your budget**: Add budget items to each category and set planned amounts
5. **Import transactions**: Click "Sync All" in the Accounts page to import from your bank
6. **Categorize transactions**: In the Budget view, assign transactions from the "New" tab to budget items, or split them across multiple categories
7. **Track spending**: The actual amount updates automatically as you categorize transactions
8. **Stay balanced**: Keep your budget balanced by ensuring Buffer + Income = Total Expenses
9. **Review monthly**: Use Insights > Monthly Summary to review your spending and plan for next month
