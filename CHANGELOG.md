# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-31 - Custom Categories, Recurring Auto-Reset & UI Improvements

### Added
- **Custom budget categories** — "Add Group" button creates user-defined categories with name and emoji
  - Slugified category keys for DB storage
  - Hash-based color assignment for charts
  - Delete custom categories (cascade deletes items and transactions)
  - Custom categories carry over via "Copy from previous month"
- **Expanded emoji picker** — 130+ emojis organized in 12 searchable groups (Finance, Home, Transport, Food, Health, Education, Kids & Pets, Fun, Giving, Travel, Work, Nature)
- **Recurring payment auto-reset** — when `nextDueDate` passes, automatically advances to next period and resets `fundedAmount` to 0
  - Handles multiple missed periods (e.g., app not opened for 3 months)
  - Runs on budget GET endpoint (when any month loads)
- **"Left to Budget" in Buffer Flow** — Monthly Report projected buffer now includes unallocated money: `Projected = Underspent - Overspent + Left to Budget`
- **Accounts grouped by institution** — Settings page groups linked bank accounts under their institution name
- **Budget category API** (`/api/budget-categories`) — POST to create, DELETE to remove custom categories

### Changed
- `CategoryType` changed from fixed 8-value union to `string` to support custom categories
- `Budget.categories` changed from fixed object shape to `Record<string, BudgetCategory>`
- Budget page renders categories dynamically (income first, defaults, custom, saving last)
- Chart helpers derive category keys dynamically from budget data instead of hardcoded arrays
- Chart colors use `DefaultCategoryType` for built-in categories, hash-based palette for custom
- `getCategoryEmoji()` now accepts stored emoji from DB, falling back to defaults
- DB schema: added `emoji` (text, nullable) and `categoryOrder` (integer) columns to `budget_categories`

### Fixed
- Copy budget now creates custom categories in target budget when they don't exist

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-31 - Tablet Responsiveness & Deployment Prep

### Added
- **Mobile block screen** — full-screen overlay on screens < 768px with message to use a tablet or larger device
- **Sidebar auto-collapse** — sidebar defaults to collapsed on screens < 1024px with `matchMedia` resize listener
- **Summary sidebar toggle drawer** — floating action button on tablet (768–1024px) to open/close the summary sidebar as an overlay drawer
- **Transaction categorization suggestions** — merchant-based suggestion badges on uncategorized transactions using historical categorization data
- **Month/year persistence** — selected month/year carries across page navigations via URL search params

### Changed
- Responsive padding on insights, recurring, and settings pages (`p-4 lg:p-8`)
- DashboardLayout hides main content below 768px, shows MobileBlockScreen instead
- Transaction list shows all transactions grouped by month, limited to ±7 days of budget month boundaries
- Uncategorized transaction count matches filtered results

### Fixed
- **Buffer projection formula** — removed income variance (planned income adjusted on the fly) and removed current buffer double-counting; projection is now `underspent - overspent`
- **Split transaction actuals** — `budgetHelpers.ts` now checks `parentTransaction.type` to correctly handle income vs expense splits
- **Vercel build error** — excluded `scripts/` from `tsconfig.json` to prevent `better-sqlite3` import errors from old migration scripts

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-30 - Interactive Insights Charts

### Added
- **D3.js charts** on Insights page — three interactive visualizations powered by D3.js and d3-sankey
- **Budget vs Actual** — horizontal grouped bar chart comparing planned vs actual spending per category, with over-budget highlighting in red
- **Spending Trends** — multi-line chart tracking spending by category over the last 3 months, with clickable legend to toggle category visibility
- **Cash Flow (Sankey)** — 3-column flow diagram: Sources (Buffer, Income) → Categories → Individual Budget Items, with gradient-colored flows and detailed hover tooltips
- **Chart infrastructure** — shared tooltip component, empty state component, category color mapping, and data transformation utilities
- **Multi-month data fetching** — insights page loads current + 2 previous months for trend analysis

### Changed
- Insights page max width increased from `max-w-4xl` to `max-w-6xl`
- Replaced "Coming Soon" placeholder cards with live interactive charts
- Added refresh button with loading spinner to insights page

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-29 - Supabase Migration & Mobile Prep

### Added
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** — migrated from SQLite to Supabase for multi-device sync
- **Capacitor** — live server mode for future iOS/Android builds
- **Previous month transactions** — sidebar "New" tab shows last 3 days of previous month with month headings
- **Data migration script** (`scripts/migrate-data.ts`) — migrates all 7 tables with FK ordering and sequence resets

### Changed
- **Database driver:** `better-sqlite3` → `postgres` via `drizzle-orm/postgres-js`
- **Schema:** All tables converted from `sqliteTable` to `pgTable` with PostgreSQL types
- **Teller sync optimized** — batch queries replace N+1 pattern (~60s → fast)
- **Numeric handling:** All `numeric` column reads wrapped with `parseFloat(String())` across 10+ files

### Fixed
- **Monthly Report** — Saving category no longer counted as expense in totals
- **Split transaction edit** — `.toFixed()` error fixed for PostgreSQL numeric strings
- **Claim data endpoint** — `.changes` replaced with `.returning().length` for PostgreSQL

### Architecture Decision
- **Phase 5 (Edge Functions) skipped** — Next.js API routes connect directly to Supabase PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. No functional benefit to migrating to Deno-based Edge Functions. See CLAUDE.md for full rationale.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-29 - Build Fix

### Fixed
- **Production build failure** — wrapped `useSearchParams()` in Suspense boundary on `/recurring` page (required by Next.js for static prerendering)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-29 - Onboarding & Empty States (Final SQLite Release)

### Added
- **Interactive onboarding** — 6-step guided setup for new users at `/onboarding`
  - Welcome → Concepts → Set Buffer → Create Budget Items → Add Transaction → Complete
  - Suggested budget items as clickable pill badges (Rent $1,200, Groceries $400, etc.)
  - Suggested transactions as quick-fill badges based on items created during onboarding
  - Progress persisted in database — users can resume if interrupted
  - Skip option for experienced users
- **"Getting Started" sidebar link** — revisit onboarding anytime (FaLightbulb icon)
- **Onboarding API** (`/api/onboarding`) — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH for status tracking
- **`user_onboarding` database table** — tracks currentStep, completedAt, skippedAt per user
- **Migration script** (`scripts/migrate-add-onboarding.ts`) for existing users
- **Monthly report empty states** — friendly messages for new users with no spending data
  - Top Spending Items: empty state message instead of empty table
  - Potential Reallocation: hidden when no spending recorded
  - Category Breakdown: "No spending recorded yet" note
  - Buffer Flow: contextual help text for new vs active users
- `.env.example` file for easier setup

### Changed
- Sign-up now redirects to `/onboarding` instead of `/`
- Main page (`/`) checks onboarding status and redirects if incomplete

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-28 - Auth Page Theming & UI Polish

### Added

### Changed
- Progress bar color changed from `bg-primary-light` to `bg-success` (green) with glow shadows

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-27 - UI Overhaul & Design System

### Added
- **Outfit font** via `next/font/google`
- **Emerald design system** — semantic CSS color tokens in `globals.css` mapped to Tailwind

### Changed
